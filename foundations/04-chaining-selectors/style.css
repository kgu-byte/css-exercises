/* This is a comment in CSS */

/* For the avatar class I did not add the .proportioned class since I realized that
their were only two test examples. This means that the .avatar.distorted would take effect
only on the image with distorted in it's name, while the .avatar would affect the rest which
in this case would be the only other test image which is the avatar proportioned one.
